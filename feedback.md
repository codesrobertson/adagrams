## Major Learning Goals/Code Review

<!-- Instructors: Feel free to practice creating specific feedback by referencing a line of code if you'd like. For example, you may say something like "nice custom method in `calculator.rb` line 42." This is optional. -->

| Criteria | yes/no, and optionally any details/lines of code to reference |
| --- | --- |
| Correctly creates and calls methods with proper syntax (parameters, return statements, etc.) | ✔️
| Uses correct syntax for conditional logic and iteration | ✔️
| Practices git with at least 3 small commits and meaningful commit messages | ✔️
| Utilizes unit tests to verify code; tests can run using the command `$ rake` and we see test successes and/or failures | ✔️
| Practices pair programming; the reflection question on pair programming is answered | ✔️

## Functional Requirements

| Functional Requirement | yes/no |
| --- | --- |
| For the `draw_letters` method, there is an appropriate data structure to store the letter distribution. (You are more likely to draw an 'E' than an 'X'.) | ✔️
| Utilizes unit tests to verify code; all tests for `draw_letters` and `uses_available_letters?` pass | ✔️
| Utilizes unit tests to verify code; all tests for `score_word` pass | ✔️
| Utilizes unit tests to verify code; all tests for `highest_score_from` pass | ✔️

## Overall Feedback

| Overall Feedback | Criteria | yes/no |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Green (Meets/Exceeds Standards) | 4+ in Code Review && 3+ in Functional Requirements | ✔️
| Yellow (Approaches Standards) | 3+ in Code Review && 2+ in Functional Requirements | ✔️
| Red (Not at Standard) | 0-2 in Code Review or 0,1 in Functional Reqs, or assignment is breaking/doesn’t run with less than 5 minutes of debugging | ✔️

<!-- Instructors, feel free to ignore this section if there's nothing else to add. -->

## Code Style Bonus Awards

<!-- Instructors: Please strike a balance between liberal/stingy with these. These are simply built-in pieces of positive feedback; use this to encourage and push students towards a cleaner code style! -->
